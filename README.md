# Personal Revision About API and  Database connections

###Progress made today
The application above is made with Flask RESTful and can enable user registration.

for the time being, The Application can only register a user and store the infomation in a mariadb with mysql and just for the record, 
i have also used external frameworks which is so highly not recomended by the Assignments given to us but 
since its a side work, i used bootsrap to help in creating the pages faster and easier to get more information 
in a shorter time.

The application i have designed was to mainly help me get the concept of end points and python classes which i 
presume i have acquired some knowledge about, despite the fact that i have not yet completed all the 4 required end points, 
i am of the hope that in a short time i will have them all working.

#ATTACHED
Attached are the pictures of Stored informatin in the data base.
